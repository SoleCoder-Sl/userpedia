# Verify & Fix Supabase Database

## Step 1: Check Your Data

Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor** and run this query to see what's saved:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  display_name,
  image_url,
  created_at
FROM biographies
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### What You Should See:

| name | display_name | image_url | created_at |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| shah rukh khan | Shah Rukh Khan | https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=... | 2024-... |
| mahatma gandhi | Mahatma Gandhi | null or URL | 2024-... |

## Step 2: Check for Issues

### Problem: `image_url` is NULL

If you see `null` in the `image_url` column, it means the portrait wasn't saved. This could be because:
1. The webhook didn't return a valid URL
2. The row didn't exist when we tried to update it (timing issue)
3. The name formats didn't match

### Problem: Wrong Images Showing

If different people show the same image, there might be duplicate or incorrect entries.

## Step 3: Clear Bad Data (Optional)

If you want to start fresh and regenerate everything, run:

```sql
-- Option 1: Delete specific person
DELETE FROM biographies 
WHERE name = 'shah rukh khan';

-- Option 2: Clear image URLs only (keeps biographies)
UPDATE biographies 
SET image_url = NULL;

-- Option 3: Delete ALL data (start completely fresh)
DELETE FROM biographies;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: After deleting, the next search will regenerate the data and call the webhook again.

## Step 4: Test with Enhanced Logging

1. Clear your browser cache or hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Search for "Shah Rukh Khan"
3. Watch the terminal logs - you should now see:

```
üîç Checking cache for: "shah rukh khan"
üìä Database query result: { data: { image_url: null }, error: null }
‚ùå No cached portrait for: Shah Rukh Khan (image_url: null)
üé® Generating portrait for: Shah Rukh Khan
‚úÖ Portrait generated for Shah Rukh Khan: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=...
üíæ Attempting to save portrait URL for: "shah rukh khan" -> https://...
‚úÖ Portrait URL saved for: Shah Rukh Khan (1 row(s) updated)
```

## Step 5: Verify Caching Works

1. Search for the same person again (e.g., "Shah Rukh Khan")
2. This time you should see:

```
üîç Checking cache for: "shah rukh khan"
üìä Database query result: { data: { image_url: 'https://...' }, error: null }
‚úÖ Portrait found in cache for: Shah Rukh Khan -> https://drive.google.com/uc?...
```

3. The image should load INSTANTLY (no webhook call!)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "‚ö†Ô∏è No rows updated for: [name]. Row might not exist yet."

**Cause**: The biography API hasn't created the row before the portrait API tries to update it.

**Solution**: This is a race condition. The biography is created asynchronously. Try searching for the person again - the second time it should work.

### Issue: Image shows MG.png for everyone

**Cause**: `image_url` is null or invalid in the database.

**Solution**: 
1. Check the webhook is returning valid URLs (see terminal logs)
2. Delete the row and search again to regenerate
3. Verify the Google Drive links are public

### Issue: Different image every time I search

**Cause**: Portrait isn't being cached, webhook generates new image each time.

**Solution**: Check terminal logs to see if the UPDATE query is actually updating rows:
- If you see "‚úÖ Portrait URL saved (1 row(s) updated)" - it's working!
- If you see "‚ö†Ô∏è No rows updated" - the row doesn't exist yet, try again

## Quick Fix: Force Regenerate Specific Person

```sql
-- Clear specific person's data
DELETE FROM biographies WHERE name = 'shah rukh khan';

-- Then search for them again - fresh data will be generated
```

---

## After Making Changes

Search for any person and check:
1. ‚úÖ The correct image loads
2. ‚úÖ The same person shows the same image each time (cached)
3. ‚úÖ Different people show different images
4. ‚úÖ Terminal shows "Portrait found in cache" on second search

**Your database is working correctly!** üéâ
